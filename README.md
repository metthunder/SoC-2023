# SoC-2023
I'd learnt many new things from my SoC Project of Competitive Programming under mentorship of Virendra Kabra. I felt like this is in the continuation of our course CS 101 where I left off. Starting from week 1 which were the basic STL of C++ like vectors, maps, sets, etc..., those were quite easy to understand then I did 8-10 problems from the introductory problems portion of CSES that was given by my mentor, then going onto week 2 which was mainly on sorting & serching like covering basic sorting techniques & binary searching etc following which we discussed some popular problems related to these topics.
Then comes the week 3 which seems to be a little tougher for me to understand at the time of meet, which was on graphs & trees like what is graph & tree? How to traverse them - by depth first search method & breadth first search method & their algorithms, then some popular algorithms to find shortest paths between any two nodes, detecting negative cycles - Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman Ford algorithm, Floyd Warshall algorithm then little bit about DAGs & then the topological sort algorithm.
